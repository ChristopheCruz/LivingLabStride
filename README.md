# The STriDE Living Lab

## Living Lab

This project is beacon-based indoor localization system base at the computer science department of Dijon ([IUT de Dijon, Universit√© de Bourgogne](https://iutdijon.u-bourgogne.fr/www/)).


## STriDE

STriDE means **S**patio-temporal **T**rajectories in **D**ynamic **E**nvironment. STriDE is an ontology-based model and an infrastructure that allows to store user trajectories, to process analytics on the trajectories. The contribution of the STriDE methodology consists in grabbing the evolution of the building for further analytics.

## Datasets

In the _datasets_ repository, a set of trajectories and the OSM map (Open Street Map) can be found [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/IUT+Dijon/@47.3110164,5.068346,19.58z/data=!3m1!5s0x47f29e6eeec3b081:0xe3076a48a9fe61f1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47f29e6edc000023:0xc034427f4d6a0b09!8m2!3d47.3110124!4d5.0685015).

The "datasetMay18.csv" file is a set of student trajectories grabbed during March and May 2018. The dataset was anonymized.

The column is the following:
UserID, Datatime, Building, Floor, Long, Lat
